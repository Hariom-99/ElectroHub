## 📄 Abstract

The increasing demand for electronic components among college students has highlighted the need for an efficient platform to facilitate **renting and selling** these components within the campus. ElectroHub bridges the gap between students who own unused components and those who require them temporarily, promoting **sustainability** and **cost-effectiveness**.

We developed this solution using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, and **Firebase** for backend storage, authentication, and real-time database management. The platform features a secure login system, searchable listings, and a cart system for efficient transaction management.

Our findings show that such a platform can reduce the cost of purchasing new components and promote responsible resource sharing. Future enhancements may include a **review system**, **real-time availability updates**, and advanced UI features.
